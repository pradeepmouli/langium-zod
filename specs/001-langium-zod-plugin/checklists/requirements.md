# Specification Quality Checklist: Langium Zod Generator Plugin

**Purpose**: Validate specification completeness and quality before proceeding to planning
**Created**: 2026-02-20
**Feature**: [spec.md](../spec.md)

## Content Quality

- [x] No implementation details (languages, frameworks, APIs)
- [x] Focused on user value and business needs
- [x] Written for non-technical stakeholders
- [x] All mandatory sections completed

## Requirement Completeness

- [x] No [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers remain
- [x] Requirements are testable and unambiguous
- [x] Success criteria are measurable
- [x] Success criteria are technology-agnostic (no implementation details)
- [x] All acceptance scenarios are defined
- [x] Edge cases are identified
- [x] Scope is clearly bounded
- [x] Dependencies and assumptions identified

## Feature Readiness

- [x] All functional requirements have clear acceptance criteria
- [x] User scenarios cover primary flows
- [x] Feature meets measurable outcomes defined in Success Criteria
- [x] No implementation details leak into specification

## Notes

- The spec references Langium-specific domain terminology ($type, Reference, .langium files, DI module) which is necessary for accuracy but keeps the focus on WHAT not HOW.
- Zod is referenced as the output format (part of the feature definition) rather than as an implementation choice.
- All 18 functional requirements are testable via the acceptance scenarios in the user stories.
- Spec validated against Langium 4.x documentation to ensure domain accuracy (type hierarchy, cross-references, grammar syntax, $type discriminator).
